Additional log drivers may be available in future\n   releases of the Amazon ECS container agent. For tasks on Fargate, the\n   supported log drivers are awslogs, splunk, and awsfirelens. For tasks\n   hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the supported log drivers are awslogs,\n   fluentd, gelf, json-file, journald,syslog, splunk, and awsfirelens.\n\n   * This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater\n   on your container instance.\n\n   * For tasks that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the Amazon ECS container\n   agent must register the available logging drivers with the ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS\n   environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use\n   these log configuration options. For more information, see Amazon ECS\n   container agent configuration (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html)\n   in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.\n\n   * For tasks that are on Fargate, because you don't have access to the\n   underlying infrastructure your tasks are hosted on, any additional software\n   needed must be installed outside of the task.
