Health check parameters\nthat are specified in a container definition override any Docker health checks\nthat exist in the container image (such as those specified in a parent image\nor from the image's Dockerfile). This configuration maps to the HEALTHCHECK\nparameter of docker run.\n\nThe Amazon ECS container agent only monitors and reports on the health checks\nspecified in the task definition. Amazon ECS does not monitor Docker health\nchecks that are embedded in a container image and not specified in the container\ndefinition. Health check parameters that are specified in a container definition\noverride any Docker health checks that exist in the container image.\n\nYou can view the health status of both individual containers and a task with\nthe DescribeTasks API operation or when viewing the task details in the console.\n\nThe health check is designed to make sure that your containers survive agent\nrestarts, upgrades, or temporary unavailability.\n\nAmazon ECS performs health checks on containers with the default that launched\nthe container instance or the task.\n\nThe following describes the possible healthStatus values for a container:\n\n   * HEALTHY-The container health check has passed successfully.\n\n   * UNHEALTHY-The container health check has failed.\n\n   * UNKNOWN-The container health check is being evaluated, there's no container\n   health check defined, or Amazon ECS doesn't have the health status of\n   the container.\n\nThe following describes the possible healthStatus values based on the container\nhealth checker status of essential containers in the task with the following\npriority order (high to low):\n\n   * UNHEALTHY-One or more essential containers have failed their health\n   check.\n\n   * UNKNOWN-Any essential container running within the task is in an UNKNOWN\n   state and no other essential containers have an UNHEALTHY state.\n\n   * HEALTHY-All essential containers within the task have passed their health\n   checks.\n\nConsider the following task health example with 2 containers.\n\n   * If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN, the task health\n   is UNHEALTHY.\n\n   * If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is HEALTHY, the task health\n   is UNHEALTHY.\n\n   * If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN, the task health\n   is UNKNOWN.\n\n   * If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is HEALTHY, the task health\n   is HEALTHY.\n\nConsider the following task health example with 3 containers.\n\n   * If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN, and Container3\n   is UNKNOWN, the task health is UNHEALTHY.\n\n   * If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN, and Container3\n   is HEALTHY, the task health is UNHEALTHY.\n\n   * If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is HEALTHY, and Container3\n   is HEALTHY, the task health is UNHEALTHY.\n\n   * If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN, and Container3 is\n   HEALTHY, the task health is UNKNOWN.\n\n   * If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN, and Container3 is\n   UNKNOWN, the task health is UNKNOWN.\n\n   * If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is HEALTHY, and Container3 is\n   HEALTHY, the task health is HEALTHY.\n\nIf a task is run manually, and not as part of a service, the task will continue\nits lifecycle regardless of its health status. For tasks that are part of\na service, if the task reports as unhealthy then the task will be stopped\nand the service scheduler will replace it.\n\nThe following are notes about container health check support:\n\n   * If the Amazon ECS container agent becomes disconnected from the Amazon\n   ECS service, this won't cause a container to transition to an UNHEALTHY\n   status. This is by design, to ensure that containers remain running during\n   agent restarts or temporary unavailability. The health check status is\n   the \"last heard from\" response from the Amazon ECS agent, so if the container\n   was considered HEALTHY prior to the disconnect, that status will remain\n   until the agent reconnects and another health check occurs. There are\n   no assumptions made about the status of the container health checks.\n\n   * Container health checks require version 1.17.0 or greater of the Amazon\n   ECS container agent. For more information, see Updating the Amazon ECS\n   container agent (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html).\n\n   * Container health checks are supported for Fargate tasks if you're using\n   platform version 1.1.0 or greater. For more information, see Fargate platform\n   versions (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html).\n\n   * Container health checks aren't supported for tasks that are part of\n   a service that's configured to use a Classic Load Balancer.",
